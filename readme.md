# Preseason Digital Notebook Example
Name: **Sharan Haravu**

Section: **I2RC**

Week: **6**


## Code
The main topic this week was: **Encoder lab**

Commands: **Encoderdrive**

Subsystems: **Drivetrain**

### How does the code work?
We use methods such as getTick() and getMeters(). There are two encoders: absolute and relative. Absolute encoders get the exact position without needing to set a reference point, while relative encoder tracks the changes in positions.

### Important notes for future reference
Notes about git, and helpful resources, etc.
Do the notebook and remember to push the code onto github!
